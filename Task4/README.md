# Task 4 - Responsive Landing Page for a Tech Product

The main aim for this task was to create a landing page for a Tech-product or a SaaS tool (Software as a Service).

For this - I created a landing page for a fictional SaaS tool - TripEase, which is a booking platform to book trips and tours with ease. I also managed to create a toggle which would switch from light mode
to dark mode in terms of accesibility. I also made it responsive
